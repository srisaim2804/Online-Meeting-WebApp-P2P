- 🤝 Peer-to-Peer Architecture using WebRTC
- 🔄 Automatic Room Management
- 📅 Meeting Scheduling
- 🎯 Multiple Participant Support
- 👥 Concurrent Meetings handling
- ⏲ with 99.999% server Uptime

## Architecture

The application follows a microservices architecture with the following components:

1. **Frontend** (React + Vite)
   - User interface for meeting interactions
   - WebRTC peer connection management
   - Real-time video/audio streaming

2. **Signaling Server**
   - Manages WebSocket connections
   - Handles WebRTC signaling
   - Facilitates peer discovery and connection

3. **Meeting Server**
   - Manages meeting creation and scheduling
   - Handles participant tracking
   - Integrates with Firebase for data persistence

4. **Room Manager**
   - Controls room allocation
   - Tracks room availability
   - Manages concurrent meeting sessions

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (v7 or higher)
- Firebase account and project
- SSL certificates for HTTPS (included in `/ssl` folder for development)

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JabadeSusheelKrishna/Online-Meeting-WebApp.git
   cd Online-Meeting-WebApp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Firebase 🔥:**
   - Update Firebase configuration in `src/fire_auth.jsx` and `firestore_Database.cjs`
   - Enable Email/Password authentication in Firebase Console
   - Please follow the 🕮 [docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs) for more information about setting up firebase auth.

4. **Start the application:**

   Start all required servers (in separate terminals):

   ```bash
   # Start the frontend development server
   npm run dev

   # Start the signaling server
   npm run signalling

   # Start the meeting server
   npm run meeting

   # Start the room manager server
   npm run room_manager
   ```

## Server Details

- Frontend: Runs on port `5173` (default Vite port)
- Signaling Server: Runs on port `3000`
- Meeting Server: Runs on port `3500`
- Room Manager: Runs on port `4000`
- You can change these ports by changing them in their respective files.

## Usage

1. **Authentication:**
   - Register with email and password
   - Login with existing credentials
   - You also have to provide a username. This will be used for enhancing user experience.
